# Digitalize the 🇫🇷 "Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire"

Every french citizen has to print a paper each time they have to go out (eg: for shopping) while covid-19 quarantine 🦠. This mandatory, however this is not really eco-responsible ♻️. Why not digitalize this paper through a simple mobile application? This application is a unofficial version of the french derogation than can be built for iOS or Android thanks to React-Native.
